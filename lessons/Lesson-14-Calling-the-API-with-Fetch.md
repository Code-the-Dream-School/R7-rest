You continue to work on the same repository that was used for the previous lesson.

In addition to the above assignment, you will need to start thinking about what project you will like to build for your final project. The rubric for the final project is located here: [Ruby on Rails Final Project Rubric](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/R7-additional/wiki/Ruby-on-Rails-Final-Project-Rubric) Read through that page, come up with your idea for the final project that meets the requirements, and submit your plan using the last several questions on your usual Homework Assignment Submission Form. A mentor of the Ruby on Rails class will review your proposal and will communicate with you via Slack to let you know if you can begin your work or if your plan needs revisions before you can begin. Please contact the Class Coordinator if you have any questions.
